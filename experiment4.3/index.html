				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Part 3 of messing with an isometric tile seeded random generator. In this one the world is supposed to represent a mad max aesthetic with mostly dirt and an occasional water tile</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using a phrase as the key to a hash function we then take that hashed phrase and use it to seed a random nuber generator to create the background tiling. The randomness is not so notable here as the tiles move by realy fast and don't have any defining features to make them worth hashing. The car that chases you does change shape and is shaped based on the seeded RNG so it will be the same if you give the same world key.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I helped with the technical aspects of porting the project from glitch and to a local server as well as helping Sean bug fix.</p>
