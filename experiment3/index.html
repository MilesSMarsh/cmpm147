				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this project I set out to use perlin noise to make worlds in a way that mimics old games such as rogue or old pokemon levels.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The way I best can describe the process is in two stages. The first is making a text representation from perlin noise. The second is translating the text version into a tile map image representation. The "Overworld" images it generates are just perlin noise where lower numbers are represented as water, higher numbers are represented as land, higher than that is represented as forest, and highest is represented by deep forest. The Dungeon images are slightly different, where the perlin noise is stretched and skewed so that there are a few really high points that cross a threshold. Each of those points are then chosen to build a room, and between each room a pathway is drawn so that all the dungeon rooms are accesible, finally a chest is placed some where in the dungeon away from the walls. The text to image part of the code takes a point and tests its neighbors to see if they are similar. Depeneding upon the neighboring tiles the current tile can be drawn with context where the corners will look smoothed to make the land look nicer.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on most of the perlin noise generation and tile context mapping. I made the base code for the overworld and my teammate Sean fine tuned the parameters of the noise to make it look nice. Sean also did the animations for the water. I did the entirety of the dungeon on my own.</p>
