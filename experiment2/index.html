				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this project we worked on making a living impression of “Hota Beach in Awa Province” by Katsushika Hokusai. The image will reorient elements and produce variations of the artwork for each person.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using multiple different PCG methods we created stylized elements for different aspects of the image. For the mountains in the background I used a psuedo noise function that just randomly picks vertical positions along the horizon line. However, for the cliffs on the right side we used perlin noise to achieve the cliff look in the image.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                Sean: I really enjoyed working on this project. It was a lot of fun to slowly build a recreation of an image and see it come together geometric primative by geometric primative. We started working on it pretty early, so that was really nice, and we had a lot of times to think of different things we wanted to do and then actually implement them. A successes would be that we managed to make something that we are both proud of, the main failure of the project would probably be that we couldn't really make the grass on the cliff look like we wanted.

                Miles: I found working with perlin noise to be very satisfying. I enjoyed making the mountain, cliffs, and waves randomly generate. Animating the waves was easier than I expected, just changing the perlin noise mapping at each frame.
