				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is the first of three randomly generated isometric projects that use a hashed phrase as the seed to the random number generator. This particular project is supposed to represent a crossword puzzle and generates black and white tiles to do so. You can then click on the tiles to generate a word "horizontally" (bottom left to top right) one tile at a time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The random number generator takes a hashed key as the seed and then uses that to place black tiles throughout the board at a certain rate. Once you click on a white tile it recursivly checks to the right and left to count how large a word will fit at that specific line and where the left most tile is to begin the word. A word is then chosen at random out of a list of almost 300,000 words and checked if it fits the line. Once found, the tiles will only reveal themselves when clicked however the entire word is generated into the line at once.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was really disapointed that I wasn't able to get the vertical words working as well to make it a true crossword. I've realized that I don't particularly like working on the glitch website and would rather just work on a local server. If given more time I might make the vertical words fit and I might come back to this later to see if I can get it to work. I did all the work for this particular project and enjoyed every second of it.</p>
