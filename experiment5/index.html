				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this project the canvas is supposed to reseble images of monkeys we have chosen using a dithered Voronoi diagram.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The algorithm starts by choosing a background color and a few points to base the Voronoi diagram around. It then goes through and for every 4th point will determine which Voronoi point it is closest to and chooses its respective color. It will then move the points around checking its fitness against an evaluation function to see how similar it is to the target image and mutating off of the best fit.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I wasn't able to get the Voronoi algorithm working for the longest time. I spent forever trying different implementations and algorithms and finally ended up with a simple dithered Voronoi to help with performance. I know I need to work on the mutation function and the fitness function I just didn't get around to it.</p>
